## 📌 Notes

- The `code/` folders in each semester will contain separate folders for `frontend/` and `backend/`.
- The project will be updated iteratively with each development milestone.
- Each `reports/` folder contains docs like SRS, SDS, test plans, and progress reports.
- Diagrams are to be exported as PNG/SVG from design tools (e.g., Draw.io, Lucidchart).
